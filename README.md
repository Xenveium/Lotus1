A repository made for a test I have fabricated to find people who at least hove moderate skills in cryptography and steganography.

If you are here than you have found a link here via me (SnowyX, also known as LotusX) sending you a link on discord.
If that is not how you got here, you found it via looking for random github repositories. If this is the case, simply ignore everything here, it is unimportant.
